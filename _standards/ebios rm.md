**EBIOS Risk Manager** (EBIOS RM) is the method for assessing and treating digital risks, published by National Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI) with the support of Club EBIOS. It is not a norm, but rather a methodology, which is compliant with ISO 31000:2018 and ISO 27005:2022.  
The methodology is based on **5 workshops**, which cover all the essentials aspects of the risk assessment process. These workshops permit to achieve the right balance between **conformity** and **scenarios**.

**Note:** Since this methodology is provided by a French agency, this cheat sheet is exceptionally only in French in order to use the proper taxonomy! :rooster: But ANSSI has provided documentation both in [French](https://cyber.gouv.fr/la-methode-ebios-risk-manager) and in [English](https://cyber.gouv.fr/publications/ebios-risk-manager-method). The modelling illustrates a fictitious use case, based on an unsecure privileged access management solution provider.
