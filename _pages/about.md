I always draft a technical model when learning about a new cybersecurity topic. Properly modeling functional features, physical components, and data exchanges, is worth a thousand words.  
I try to keep it simple, so it is probably not self-sufficient to fully understand the topic from scratch. But it is for sure a quick reminder of technical discussions.

## Who am I?

I am a system architect, currently working in the space industry. This website regroups some of my cybersecurity cheat-sheets. Hopefully I won't lose them anymore! I hope it helps!
