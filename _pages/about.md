A nice drawing is often more efficient than a long text. It is probably not the best way to start learning about a new topic from scratch, but it is for sure a quick reminder of technical discussions. This site regroups some of my drawings. Hopefully I won't lose them anymore! I hope it can help! :smile:

## Who am I?

I am a cybersecurity architect, mostly working in governance, risk management and compliance at the moment. But I strive to stay up to date about the underlying technical architectures, which is always a valuable reason to craft a technical drawing.

## My main topics

- Cyber Threat Intelligence
- Network Intrusion Detection Systems
- Secure architectures
- Cybersecurity for space
