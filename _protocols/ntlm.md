## Introduction

Authentication within a Windows domain relies on the **NTLM** or **Kerberos** protocols. NTLMv2 is deprecated, but it is still used as a backup when Kerberos fails.

**Note:** Active Directory is a solution developed by Microsoft for the management of an information system. It contains:
- a resource directory service (LDAP)
- an authentication scheme (Kerberos)
- a domain resolution service (DNS)
- a software policy
</div>

In this example, let's consider the user Alice who tries to authenticate! We detail the authentication scheme for:
- **interactive logon:** the user provides inputs for authentication against a server or a Domain Controller.
- **network logon:** the authentication performed by the user as part of interactive logon is used again to log the user on another resource.

### Interactive logon with NTLM

### Network logon with NTLM

### Kerberos

Kerberos is the successor of NTLM. And guess what? It is also broken! :monkey: Letâ€™s review the Kerberos authentication process, and illustrate the most common attacks on Kerberos.
