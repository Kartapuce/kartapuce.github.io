## FIDO2

**FIDO2** is an open authentication standard. It is developed by the FIDO (*Fast IDentity Online*) Alliance. It is based on 2 specifications:
- the W3C **Web Authentication** specification (WebAuthn API)
- the **Client to Authentication Protocol** (CTAP2) between the authenticator and the client.

FIDO2 provides a strong **passwordless** authentication, with 2 authentication factors. :fire:
